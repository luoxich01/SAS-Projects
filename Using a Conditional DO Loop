/*
Add a conditional DO loop around the assignment statement where IncrDayVisits is being increased by 6%.
The DO UNTIL statement should execute until the value of IncrDayVisits exceeds 100,000.
Write a row to the output table for each iteration of the DO loop.

Before the DO loop, add an assignment statement to set the Year to 0.
Within the DO loop, add a sum statement to add 1 to the value of Year.
Add Year to the KEEP statement so we know how many years it takes to reach the visitor goal.
