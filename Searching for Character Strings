/*
Create a new column named Park that uses the SUBSTR function read the value in ParkName and exclude the NP code at the end of the string. Hint: Use the FIND function to identify the position number of the NP string. That value can be used as the third argument of the SUBSTR function to specify how many characters to read.
Convert the Location column to proper case. Use the COMPBL function to remove any extra blanks between words.
Create a new column named Gate by using the TRANWRD function to read Location and convert the string Traffic Count At to a blank.
Create a new column named GateCode that concatenates ParkCode and Gate together with a single hyphen between the strings.
