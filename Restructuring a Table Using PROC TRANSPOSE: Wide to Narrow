Submit the PROC PRINT step to display the first five rows of pg2.np_2017camping. Notice that the table contains three columns (Tent, RV, and Backcountry) with visitor counts for each value of ParkName. In addition, notice that the table is sorted by ParkName.
In the PROC TRANSPOSE step, add the OUT= option to create a table named work.camping2017_t.
Add a BY statement to group the data by ParkName. This creates one row in the output table for each unique value of ParkName.
Add a VAR statement to transpose the Tent and RV columns.
Submit the PROC TRANSPOSE step and examine the output data.
