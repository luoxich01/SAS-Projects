Submit the two PROC SORT steps. Determine the name of the common column in the sorted tables.
Modify the second PROC SORT step to use the RENAME= option to rename Code to ParkCode in the pg2.np_2016traffic table. 
Modify the BY statement to sort by the new column name.
Write a DATA step to merge the sorted tables by the common column to create a new table, work.trafficstats.
Exclude the Name_Code column in the output table.
