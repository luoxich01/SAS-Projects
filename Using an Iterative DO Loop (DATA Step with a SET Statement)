/*
Submit the program and examine the results. Notice that the initial program is showing the forecasted value for the next year. The next year is based on adding one year to the year value of today's date.
In the program, add an iterative DO loop around the conditional IF-THEN statements. The DO loop should iterate five times.
In the DO statement, the index column Year should start at the value of NextYear and stop at the value of NextYear plus 4.
Write one row for each year to the output table.
Modify the KEEP statement to keep the column Year instead of NextYear.
